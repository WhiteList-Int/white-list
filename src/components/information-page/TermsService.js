                    <br /><br />
                    11.2.1 WhiteList is a housing listing portal designed to connect Properties and Tenants so they can potentially arrange bookings of Accommodations directly with each other. WhiteList is not an owner or operator of properties including but not limited to hotel rooms, motel rooms, other accommodations or Accommodations. WhiteList is not a provider of properties including but not limited to hotel rooms, motel rooms, other accommodations or Accommodations. WhiteList does not own, sell, resell, furnish, provide, rent, re-lease, manage and/or control properties including but not limited to hotel rooms, motel rooms, other accommodations or Accommodations or transportation or travel Services. Unless explicitly specified otherwise in the WhiteList platform, WhiteList's responsibilities are strictly limited to: (i) making available the Website and Services and (ii) serving as the limited payment transmitting agent of the Property to transmit payments from Tenants to the Property.
                    <br /><br />
                    11.2.2 Each Property hereby appoints WhiteList as the limited payment transmitting agent of the Property to transmit payments from Tenants to the Property. Each Property agrees that payment made by a Tenant via WhiteList shall be considered the same as payment made directly to the Property, and the Property will make the Accommodation available to the Tenant in the agreed-upon manner as if the Property has received the Accommodation Fees. Each Property agrees that WhiteList may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Property and reflected in the relevant Listing, (a) permit the Tenant to cancel the booking, and (b) refund via WhiteList to the Tenant the portion of the Accommodation Fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy. Each Property understands that WhiteList accepts payments from Tenants as the Property's limited payment transmitting agent, and that WhiteList's obligation to pay the Property is subject to and conditional on the successful receipt of the related payments from Tenants. WhiteList does not guarantee payments to Properties for amounts that have not been successfully received by WhiteList from Tenants. WhiteList assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Property in accepting appointment as the Property's limited payment transmitting agent.
                    <br /><br />
                    11.2.3 You agree that you are solely responsible for any and all information regarding the Listings and Content posted by you. You represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the booking of, or a Tenant's stay at, an Accommodation in a Listing you post (a) will (i) be compliant with all applicable laws including but not limited to zoning laws and laws governing residential, commercial or other rentals, Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may be applicable to any Accommodation included in a Listing posted by you (including but not limited to all required permits, licenses and registrations), and (ii) not conflict with the rights of any third party, and (b) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties including but not limited to homeowners association, condominium, lease or rental agreements. At any time and without prior notice, WhiteList reserves the right to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that WhiteList considers in its sole discretion to be objectionable for any reason, or in violation of these Terms or WhiteList's then prevailing Policies and Community Guidelines (provide link), or otherwise harmful to the Website or Services.
                    <br /><br />
                    11.2.4 You as a Property agree that WhiteList does not act as your contracting agent or as an insurer. If a Tenant requests a booking of your Accommodation or stays at your Accommodation, any agreement you enter into with such Tenant is an agreement solely between you and the Tenant to which WhiteList is not a party. WhiteList only serves as the limited payment transmitting agent of the Property to transmit payments from Tenants to the Property.
                    <br /><br />
                    11.2.5 Even though WhiteList provides certain tools to you as a Property to make informed decisions about other Members, you agree that you as a Property are solely responsible for your own acts, and omissions and are also solely responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who reside at or are otherwise present at the Accommodation at your request or invitation, excluding the Tenant and the individuals, if any, invited to the Accommodation by the Tenant.
                    <br /><br />
                    11.2.6 PROPERTIES SHOULD HAVE OR CHECK THEIR OWN INSURANCE: WhiteList recommends that the Properties obtain necessary or suitable insurance for their Accommodations. You as a Property should review carefully any insurance policy you may have for your Accommodation, paying particular attention to any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may be applicable for, such insurance policy, including but not limited to whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Tenants and the individuals, if any, invited by the Tenants to the Accommodation.
                    <br /><br />
                    11.2.7 The Properties, not WhiteList, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed bookings and making available any Accommodations reserved via the Website and Services. If you as a Tenant choose to enter into a transaction with a Property for booking an Accommodation, you agree that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Property and to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Accommodation imposed by the Property. You agree that you, not WhiteList, will be (a) solely responsible for performing the obligations of such agreement, and (b) WhiteList is not a party to such agreement, and (c) with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, WhiteList disclaims all liability regarding any such agreement. You also agree to, notwithstanding the fact that WhiteList is not a party to the agreement between you and the Property, WhiteList as the Property's limited payment transmitting agent for the sole purpose of transmitting the payment from you to the Property.
                    <br /><br />
                    11.2.8 WhiteList charges the Services Fees as consideration for providing the use of WhiteList's online platform and services. Where applicable, taxes may also be charged in respect of Property Fees and Tenant Fees. WhiteList deducts the Property Fees from the Accommodation Fees before remitting the balance to the Properties as described in these Terms. WhiteList will remit the balance to Properties via cash, check, direct deposit or other payment methods as described on the Website, in the Property's currency of choice, depending on the selections the Property makes via the Website and Services. Please note that WhiteList may impose or deduct foreign currency processing costs on or from any payments or payouts by WhiteList in currencies other than Philippine Peso. More information on any such costs or deductions will be available via the Website. Services Fees are non-refundable except as otherwise provided herein.
                    <br /><br />
                    11.2.9 Please note that WhiteList currently does not charge fees for the creation of Listings. However, as a Property you agree that WhiteList reserves the right in its sole discretion to charge you for and collect fees from you for the creation of Listings. Please note that WhiteList will provide notice of any Listing Fee collection via the Website and Services prior to the implementation of such procedure of charging a Listing fee.
