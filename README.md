# whitelist

Overall Description:
WhiteList is a centralized informational display hub of various rentable locations within Cebu. It shall be developed using React, HTML, and CSS along with Firebase as its authentication and database.

WhiteList provides its users with a simplified method for finding and connecting people to rentable opportunities. It primarily is an online, software solution directed towards the needs of students and workers looking for affordable locations. The website shall be limited to displaying the available “rental” locations for the user to browse the selection. When the user determines their prospect “rental” location, they would then need to contact the owner / point personnel of that “rental” slot themselves. The website shall not offer a payment or communications channel as it will only involve itself within the search and connection phases of the user’s journey.
